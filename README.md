# Magic the Gathering CLI
### Command line application for searching the Scryfall database
#### This application is not associated with Wizards of the Coast or Scryfall

## Usage
The command starts with `python cli.py`. From there, append one of the following to get to that functionality:

* `cardSearch` - Functions like the standard search on Scryfall (currently limited to card name only and 175 results)
* `exactCard` - Returns a card only if the name is exact (case-insensitive and optional punctuation)
* `fuzzyCard` - Returns a card if the Scryfall server is confident that you unambiguously identified a unique name with your input
* `randomCard` - Returns a random card

## Examples
A `>` signifies user input
